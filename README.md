# SDQ
Psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. 

## Repository description
This repository is a space for any SDQ-related analyses I did or shall conduct. I worked with the SDQ in my diploma thesis (to be defended in June 2022) and I am preparing at least two papers dealing with the SDQ.

## About the SDQ
>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (R. Goodman, 2001) is a 25-item measure intended to be administered to different inform-ants: it has a parent, teacher, and a self-report version (for 11+ youth). Thanks to this multi-informant characteristic, it allows to evaluate children and youth in a wide range of age: 4-17 years. The measure uses a three-point Likert-type response format with anchors “Not true”, “Somewhat true”, and “Certainly true”. 
>The SDQ is supposed to measure five constructs via subscales: Hyperactivity/Inattention, Conduct Problems, Emotional Problems, Peer Problems, and Prosocial Behavior, each represented by five items. The first four of the constructs are considered to constitute a “negative-difficulties” measure of Total Difficulties, while the Prosocial Behavior scale represents a “positive-strengths” side of the scale (see Figure 1). Researchers also use other partitions of the 25 items, e.g., Externalization and Internalization.
